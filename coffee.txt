Iced and Cold Coffees
Iced Coffee: Brewed coffee served over ice. It’s often sweetened and sometimes mixed with milk.
Cold Brew: Coffee brewed slowly with cold water for 12-24 hours. It’s smoother and less acidic than regular iced coffee.
Affogato: A dessert-style coffee where a shot of hot espresso is poured over vanilla ice cream.
